When it comes to picking which technology we should be utilizing in our next project we now have more options than ever before. Which language? Which Runtime? Which Front-end framework? Which Back-end framework? You can quickly find yourself falling victim to analysis paralysis. There's no silver bullet to this problem but in this article I'm going to outline some questions you should be asking.

## Community

You can use a variety of techniques to get a feel for the strength of a tools community. If the tool is open-sourced GitHub is usually a good place to start, take note of the number of stars and contributors as well as how responsive the community are to issues. I would also take advantage of StackOverflow's [tags page](https://stackoverflow.com/tags) to see how many questions are tagged as associated with your tool.

When it comes to picking a framework or a language I believe this to be a key factor.

An involved community mean quicker fixes, more tutorials, more Stack overflow questions.
